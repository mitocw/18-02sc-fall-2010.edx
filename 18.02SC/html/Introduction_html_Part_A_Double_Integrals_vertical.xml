  <p>In part A, we will learn about double integration over regions in the plane. Conceptually an integral is a sum. We will apply this idea to computing the mass, center of mass and moment of inertia of a two dimensional body and the volume of a region bounded by surfaces.</p>
  <p>In order to compute double integrals we will have to describe regions in the plane in terms of the equations describing their boundary curves. After that, the computation just becomes two single variable integrations done iteratively.</p>
